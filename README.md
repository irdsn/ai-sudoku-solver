## Introduction

AISudokuSolver is a fully autonomous pipeline that solves Sudoku puzzles from images, integrating computer vision, deep learning, and symbolic reasoning.

The system extracts and interprets the puzzle board from a photo or scan using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition. The board is then solved using an optimized backtracking algorithm enhanced with constraint propagation and variable ordering heuristics.

In addition to solving the puzzle, AISudokuSolver records a detailed trace of the resolution process and generates a structured Markdown report enriched with a natural language summary powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This summary interprets the solving strategy, highlights key decisions, and estimates puzzle complexity.

The project is designed as a robust, testable, and educational framework that combines traditional algorithmic techniques with modern AI capabilities. It is ideal for exploring computer vision pipelines, algorithm design, and LLM-based analytics in a real-world use case.

## Computer Vision & Digit Recognition

This system uses computer vision techniques to extract the Sudoku grid from a photograph and classify its digits using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Below is an overview of the full process:

### Input Image → Grid Segmentation

Each input image is processed to detect the outer contour of the Sudoku grid, which is then warped into a perfect square. This grid is divided into 81 individual square cells.

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme_images/sudoku.jpg" alt="Sudoku Input Example" width="350"/>
</div>

### Cell Extraction and Labeling

The extracted cells are saved as individual grayscale images (50x50 pixels), ready to be labeled manually into categories: digits 1–9 or empty. These labeled images are later organized into folders for training.

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme_images/5_cell.png" alt="Digit 5 Example" width="125"/>
  <img src="readme_images/empty_cell.png" alt="Empty Cell Example" width="125"/>
</div>

### Dataset Structure

The labeled dataset is organized into three partitions for training, validation, and testing. Each partition contains one folder per digit class (0–9), where `0` represents an empty cell.

| Partition  | Path                  | Digits per Class | Total Images |
|------------|------------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Train      | `datasets/train/`      | ~450             | 4,064        |
| Validation | `datasets/val/`        | ~100             | 912          |
| Test       | `datasets/test/`       | ~100             | 900          |

> Dataset was created by manually labeling extracted cells using `extrac_cells.py` and human review.

### CNN Architecture

The CNN used to classify the digits is defined with the following architecture:

```bash
Input: (50, 50, 1) grayscale image
│
├── Conv2D(32, 3x3, relu)
├── MaxPooling2D(2x2)
├── Dropout(0.25)
│
├── Conv2D(64, 3x3, relu)
├── MaxPooling2D(2x2)
├── Dropout(0.25)
│
├── Flatten()
├── Dense(128, relu)
├── Dropout(0.5)
└── Dense(10, softmax)
```

- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy  
- **Optimizer:** Adam  
- **Epochs:** 100 (early stopping triggered at epoch 56)  
- **Callbacks:** EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint

The trained model is saved in:
```bash
cnn_classifier/model/digit_model.keras
```

### Evaluation Metrics

The final model achieved the following performance:

| Metric                      | Value   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Train Accuracy (final)      | 0.9967  |
| Validation Accuracy (final) | 1.0000  |
| Train Loss (final)          | 0.0089  |
| Validation Loss (final)     | 0.0000  |
| Test Accuracy               | 1.0000  |
| Test Loss                   | 0.0000  |

The classifier demonstrates near-perfect performance across all partitions, making it a reliable digit recognizer in the Sudoku solving pipeline.

### Training Visualizations

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme_images/training_plot.png" alt="Training Accuracy Curve" width="480"/>
</div>

### Confusion Matrix

<div align="center">
  <img src="readme_images/confusion_matrix.png" alt="Confusion Matrix" width="480"/>
</div>

The confusion matrix confirms that the classifier correctly predicted every single instance in the test set without error.

The classifier demonstrates excellent generalization across cleanly segmented Sudoku cells and is robust for use in the automated solving pipeline.

The model is stored in `cnn_classifier/model/digit_model.keras` and used at runtime to classify new cell images.

4. Add your OpenAI key on the .env file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

You can use **AISudokuSolver** in two main ways, depending on whether you want an interactive CLI experience or access it programmatically via a local REST API.

### Option 1: Run via CLI (recommended for individual use)

Execute the full solving pipeline by running the main script:

```bash
python aisudokusolver.py
```

You will be prompted to select a Sudoku image (JPG or PNG). The pipeline will:

1. Parse and segment the board from the image. 
2. Use a CNN to classify each cell. 
3. Solve the puzzle using backtracking with MRV & forward checking. 
4. Save the outputs to your Downloads/AISudokuSolver/ folder, including:
   - Input image
   - Markdown report (MD)
   - Solving trace (JSON)
   - Console log (LOG)

### Option 2: Run the FastAPI server locally

Expose the functionality via a local REST API by launching the FastAPI app:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Then open the interactive documentation at:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

You can test the /solve endpoint directly from the Swagger UI, or use curl:
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve' \
  -F 'image=@inputs/easy.jpg' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data'
```

A successful response will look like:
```bash
{
  "parsed_board": [[5,3,0,...]],
  "solved_board": [[5,3,4,...]],
  "steps": 34,
  "duration": 0.92
}
```

The complete output files will be saved in your Downloads/AISudokuSolver/ folder.

## Important Notes

- The CNN model for digit recognition was trained from scratch using manually labeled Sudoku cell images. You can retrain or improve this model by updating the dataset in `/datasets/train`, `/datasets/val`, and `/datasets/test`.
- Input images must clearly show a front-facing, well-lit Sudoku grid. While the system includes preprocessing steps like resizing, binarization, and grid orientation correction, highly skewed or low-contrast images may lead to errors in segmentation or digit classification.
- The solving algorithm combines an optimized backtracking approach with **Minimum Remaining Value (MRV)** heuristics and **forward checking** for constraint propagation. Only the final placements are included in the solving trace, not the full decision tree.
- To generate the optional LLM-based summary, an OpenAI API key must be provided via a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
- All reports, traces, and log files are saved under the ~/Downloads/AISudokuSolver/ folder. Each output set is named based on the original input image filename and includes:
  - A .md Markdown report
  - A .json solving trace
  - A .log console output snapshot
- The FastAPI server is currently intended for local usage only. A public deployment for easier external access is planned as a future improvement. This could also include the development of a user-friendly graphical interface.

> This modular pipeline enables easy retraining, debugging, and extension of both the vision and logic components.

## Final Words

This project originated from my personal passion for Sudoku puzzles and the challenge of building a system capable of solving them end-to-end — from visual recognition to logical resolution.

It has been designed as a fully autonomous pipeline that blends classic algorithmic techniques with modern AI models.The result is a practical system that combines computer vision, deep learning, and LLM-based interpretation — all within a structured, testable, and reproducible framework.

Feel free to explore, extend, or integrate it into your own applications. Contributions, feedback, or improvements are always welcome.
